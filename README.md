# CodeForces
these are the peseudo code for each problem

#vanya and fence
arr(0)= i 
arr(1)=h
loop into the length(i)
compare between values
value of length(n)<=value of h
count+1
if value > h 
count+2

#anton and danik
arr(n) string
loop in n
compare string if A , anton+
else danik+
print the higher value
